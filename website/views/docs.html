    <h1>Share files</h1>
    <p>
      Orchidei's file manager allows you to easily share your files across multiple devices. Here's how:
    </p>

    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Right-click on the file you want to share and press the "Share" button.</li>
      <li>A dialog box will open with additional settings, where you can set a limit on the number of downloads for the
        file before it is deleted.</li>
      <li>Press "Share" and you will receive a secret hash. DO NOT SHARE THIS HASH as it will allow access to the shared
        file.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h1>Share files</h1>
    <p>
      To receive a shared file, follow these steps:
    </p>

    <p>
    <ul>
      <li> Click on the folder where you want to save the file and press the "Receive" button.</li>
      <li> A dialog box will open where you can paste the secret hash you received.</li>
      <li>Press "Download" and the shared file will be saved to the selected folder.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      In summary, Orchidei's "Share Files" feature allows you to easily share files with others and limit the number of
      downloads before it is deleted. And, to receive the shared file, paste the secret hash in the "Receive" dialog box
      and press "Download."
